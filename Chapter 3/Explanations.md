#### Exercise 1: Even Or Odd ####
The goal is to check if an integer is odd or even. Odd numbers are numbers that are not  
divisible by 2. Even numbers are divisible by 2. So all that needs to be done here is to  
check if the number is divisible by 2:

  if num is divisible by 2:  
  .    print "Even"  
  else:  
  .    print "Odd"  

With this logic, zero (0) which is neutral will be seen as an even number as 0/2 = 0.  
The code is meant to be simple, so there's no check for zero as input.

#### Exercise 2: Divisible By 5 and 7 ####
We are tasked with finding out if an integer is divisible by both 5 and 7. For an integer  
to be divisible by any number <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, for example, it has to be divisible  
by the lowest common multiple (LCM) of x and y. The LCM of two or more numbers is at least  
the maximum of all the numbers involved.
