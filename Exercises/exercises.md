### Chapter 2 ###
1. Declare several variables by selecting for each one of them the most 
appropriate of the types sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, long
and ulong in order to assign them the following values: 52,130; -115; 
4825932; 97; -10000; 20000; 224; 970,700,000; 112; -44; -1,000,000; 
1990; 123456789123456789.
2. Which of the following values can be assigned to variables of type float, 
double and decimal: 5, -5.01, 34.567839023; 12.345; 8923.1234857;
3456.091124875956542151256683467?
3. Write a program, which compares correctly two real numbers with 
accuracy at least 0.000001.
4. Initialize a variable of type int with a value of 256 in
hexadecimal format (256 is 100 in a numeral system with base 16).
5. Declare a variable of type char and assign it as a value the character, 
which has Unicode code, 72 (use the Windows calculator in order to find 
hexadecimal representation of 72).
6. Declare a variable isMale of type bool and assign a value to it depending 
on your gender.
7. Declare two variables of type string with values "Hello" and "World". 
Declare a variable of type object. Assign the value obtained of 
concatenation of the two string variables (add space if necessary) to this 
variable. Print the variable of type object.
8. Declare two variables of type string and give them values "Hello" and 
"World". Assign the value obtained by the concatenation of the two 
variables of type string (do not miss the space in the middle) to a 
variable of type object. Declare a third variable of type string and 
initialize it with the value of the variable of type object (you should use 
type casting).
9. Declare two variables of type string and assign them a value “The 
"use" of quotations causes difficulties.” (without the outer quotes). 
In one of the variables use quoted string and in the other do not use it.
10. Write a program to print a figure in the shape of a heart by the sign "o".
11. Write a program that prints on the console isosceles triangle which 
sides consist of the copyright character "©".
12. A company dealing with marketing wants to keep a data record of its 
employees. Each record should have the following characteristic – first 
name, last name, age, gender (‘m’ or ‘f’) and unique employee number 
(27560000 to 27569999). Declare appropriate variables needed to 
maintain the information for an employee by using the appropriate data 
types and attribute names.
13. Declare two variables of type int. Assign to them values 5 and 10 
respectively. Exchange (swap) their values and print them.  
  

  ### Chapter 3 ###
1. Write an expression that checks whether an integer is odd or even.
2. Write a Boolean expression that checks whether a given integer is 
divisible by both 5 and 7, without a remainder.
3. Write an expression that looks for a given integer if its third digit (right 
to left) is 7.
4. Write an expression that checks whether the third bit in a given integer 
is 1 or 0.
5. Write an expression that calculates the area of a trapezoid by given 
sides a, b and height h.
6. Write a program that prints on the console the perimeter and the area 
of a rectangle by given side and height entered by the user.
7. The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the 
Earth. Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the 
moon by a given weight on the Earth.
8. Write an expression that checks for a given point {x, y} if it is within 
the circle K({0, 0}, R=5). Explanation: the point {0, 0} is the center of 
the circle and 5 is the radius.
9. Write an expression that checks for given point {x, y} if it is within the 
circle K({0, 0}, R=5) and out of the rectangle [{-1, 1}, {5, 5}]. 
Clarification: for the rectangle the lower left and the upper right corners 
are given.
10. Write a program that takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd
(e.g. 2011) and performs the following actions:
- Calculates the sum of the digits (in our example 2+0+1+1 = 4).
- Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (in our 
example 1102).
- Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (in our example 1201).
- Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (in our example 
2101).
11. We are given a number n and a position p. Write a sequence of 
operations that prints the value of the bit on the position p in the 
number (0 or 1). Example: n=35, p=5 -> 1. Another example: n=35, 
p=6 -> 0.
12. Write a Boolean expression that checks if the bit on position p in the 
integer v has the value 1. Example v=5, p=1 -> false.
13. We are given the number n, the value v (v = 0 or 1) and the position p. 
write a sequence of operations that changes the value of n, so the bit on 
the position p has the value of v. Example: n=35, p=5, v=0 -> n=3. 
Another example: n=35, p=2, v=1 -> n=39.
14. Write a program that checks if a given number n (1 < n < 100) is a 
prime number (i.e. it is divisible without remainder only to itself and 1).
15. * Write a program that exchanges the values of the bits on positions 
3, 4 and 5 with bits on positions 24, 25 and 26 of a given 32-bit unsigned 
integer.
16. * Write a program that exchanges bits {p, p+1, …, p+k-1} with bits {q, 
q+1, …, q+k-1} of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.
